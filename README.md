# Robot Control System

A Python-based system for controlling a robot with voice commands, computer vision, and natural language processing capabilities.

While this code is highly customized for a specific setup, it may serve as inspiration or provide reusable components for others working on similar projects.

## Features

- 🎤 Speech-to-Text (STT): Powered by OpenAI's API.
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS): Also powered by OpenAI's API.
- 👁️ Computer Vision: Integrated webcam support for visual input.
- 🤖 Servo Motor Control: Enables precise robotic arm movements.
- 🧠 AI-Powered Interaction: Leveraging the Claude Vision-LLM model for intelligent responses.

## Demo

[todo: insert here]

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Webcam
- Microphone
- Speaker
- Robotic arm


## Usage

1. Set up your robotic arm and connect a webcam.

1. Calibrate the arm and implement the robot.py module, ensuring it defines the function:

```
execute_string_command(target_arm_position, target_arm_height, gripper)
```

1. Add your OpenAI and Anthropic API keys.

1. Launch the system using main.py to begin interacting with the robotic arm.
